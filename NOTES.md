# Notes

---

What to work on next?

- Add a "addPlayer" interface to runtime, make server assign random position to each player on join
- Render each player on each client
- Try passing local movement in, see what happens
  - any input source / management changes should happen now...
- Protobuf compatibility after?
- Once we have movement working, then continue with rendering?

- Server networking puts clients for each room ID into their own queues, so each room is self contained

## Rendering

From conversation with GÃ¶ksel:

- It is just an inverse transformation applied to your coordinate system
- With matrices this becomes rather simple, it reduces translation, rotation and scaling operations to a single multiplication :)
- World has its own transformation, and your entities in your world would each have their respective local transformations
- You then do: `finalTransform = worldTransform * entityTransform`

### NEXT STEPS

- Try to refactor `editcanvas` out, we should have a better interface
- Only certain things should be affected by the isometric `toScreen` calculations, how do we define this? On drawables themselves?
- Implement Sprite drawables
- Implement Tilemap drawable (reduce amount of Entities we have, currently for a 30x30 sprite sheet we are running 900 entities in memory! If we can reduce that down to just 1 tilemap entity that handles drawing the entirety of a tile map, that would be rad)
  - Will need some sort of interface for retrieving what "type" of tile a certain coordinate is, so we can react to things like different surface types

## Networking

- Use Protobuf: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf
- authoratative! (Dumb client tells smart server "Hey! I am facing this way and moving forward," server validates, returns it's position)
  - Slideshow at https://docs.colyseus.io/ is good

### NEXT STEPS

(Probably after tilemap?)

- Add protobuf, adjust current message types to be compatable
- Get movement working!

## Runtime

- Runtime should handle the actual creation/manaagement of entities; NOT the client or server directly
- Runtime should manage the world and game state

### NEXT STEPS

- Time class/module that tracks current time, time difference between client/server, tick duration, etc.
- Expose coordinate transformation functions for/from World (transform from normal to isometric)
- Define proper interface for `InputManager` (in `runtime/runtime.ts`)
  - This should be an interface that things such as Player character controllers can use to react to inputs
  - Should work for both client inputs and server inputs
  - Command based? ie. `MoveForward`, `StrafeLeft`, `StrafeRight`?

## Client/Server

- Client should only focus on forwarding input/local interactions to the renderer and runtime
- Server should only focus on forwarding/synching networking with the runtime

### NEXT STEPS

- Add debug text on client (fps, ping, server time diff, etc.)
- Get runtime running on the server!
- Try to pass player movement / render players on each client!
